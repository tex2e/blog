Xeno-Biology
-----------------------------

We've managed to successfully map the alien specimen's entire genome, although I wasn't entirely sure it would be possible using our existing DNA sequencing techniques. However, our success has led to the startling realization that this creature's genetic structure is quite similar to our own. This discovery has piqued the interests of the research team, as it only raises more questions as to the origin of the species...

Having examined several of the alien corpses, we've also observed a trend - key components of the alien's genetic structure are mirrored perfectly across each of the specimens. Although it is presumptive at this point to draw conclusions as to how this is possible, I believe it is only logical to assume the alien is the product of aggressive genetic engineering, well beyond anything conceived of on Earth. If the aliens are truly capable of this sort of manipulation at a cellular level, I fear we may have only scratched the surface of their technological advantages over us.

In any case, further research is imperative... and while we've obviously made a number of discoveries working with the alien corpses, I feel we may need to acquire a living specimen if we truly hope to find the answers to these questions.


Experimental Warfare
-----------------------------

As we continued our research into the alien weapons fragments and the other materials recovered from the field, we've come to realize how the aliens managed to make these substances work in conjunction with one another. While reducing the size of these components is often a challenge in itself, we decided to focus our initial efforts on a weapon more suited to deployment on our Interceptors.

This cannon was designed to concentrate energy within a small target area, and should be capable of punching through the armored hulls of the alien craft. In addition, we've also passed a number of interesting conceptual designs on to the engineering team. Dr. Shen seems confident that given the appropriate resources and testing facility, he can bring many of these concepts to life.


Elerium
-----------------------------

Having fully analyzed the strange material recovered from the alien craft, it's clear this element is unlike anything found on Earth. The unusual atomic structure of this substance responds to direct bombardment from accelerated particles, resulting in an astonishing release of energy. Although the potential applications for this element are nearly unlimited, for now, our efforts are primarily focused on power generation and propulsion schemes. However, as this material does not occur naturally in our own solar system, we must carefully manage our available supply.

Dr. Vahlen's Personal Note: To think, this single element has the potential to change the entire economic structure of Earth's energy industry. If we were to discover the source of this material, our reliance on fossil fuels could disappear within a decade.


Alien Nav Computer
-----------------------------

We've had the opportunity to study these devices in a limited fashion. As we've discovered, they do contain some form of encrypted alien data. However, they're also completely reliant on an internal power supply, which, when depleted, renders the device inaccessible. The only means we've found to gather information from this equipment is by routing its internal power supply through a crudely assembled interface that bypasses any built-in shutdown sequences.

However, the alien data itself provided an even greater obstacle, as we're dealing with a programming language that is unlike anything found in our own systems. Fortunately, the research team is quite capable and we quickly assembled a small group of our best analysts for the task. We've already begun to establish patterns in the alien encryption algorithm, revealing small bits of information that can be integrated into our research.


UFO Power Source
-----------------------------

The power supply systems recovered from the alien craft are perhaps the most important piece of technology we've retrieved so far. Although we could spend years researching the intricacies of the equipment, the urgency of our development process means we've had to rely on theoretical analysis more than I would prefer. Despite the risks involved in attempting to reverse engineer this technology, we made a number of small steps towards a fully adapted power cell. Our most important discovery so far, the element we've been referring to as "Elerium," is the vital component that provides nearly limitless energy to the alien power cells.

Although there is still much to learn, we believe it should be possible for the Engineering team to begin assembling a makeshift power cell based on our initial findings, which may prove useful in the development of an advanced fighter craft. However, we'll certainly want to do further analysis of the Elerium element that fuels the alien power systems.


Arc Thrower
-----------------------------

We've completed our research into the Arc Thrower prototype and we believe this device is ready for final production in Engineering. The mechanism functions on the basic premise of neurological disruption, emitting a focused electromagnetic pulse capable of confusing and incapacitating targets within a limited range.

As this is our first venture into the field of non-lethal weapons based on the alien physiology, it's safe to assume there may be unexpected results in the field. It's very likely that some aliens will resist the disabling effects of the weapon, in which case it might be more effective to weaken the enemy first.

The Arc Thrower is also constrained by our current power supply technology, which limits its effectiveness to two shots per deployment. Any captives retrieved from the field will have to be housed in an Alien Containment facility; I strongly advise we build that facility before attempting to capture live specimens.


Outsider Shard
-----------------------------

Analysis of the alien shard has revealed that it is indeed organic in nature, although not "alive" per se, somehow it continues to resonate within a specific range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Despite several attempts at disabling the alien known as the "Outsider," each was met with the same result - the target "dematerializing" within an instant. With no explanation for this phenomenon, the research team was left with little to study in terms of the Outsider itself. However, having now analyzed this shard, it seems that may not be the case.

In an effort to reduce any interference from known terrestrial signals, we placed the shard within the "harmonic dampening chamber," a device conceived of by Dr. Shen. With outside noise brought to a minimum, it took little effort to detect a very distinct signal... the source our shard's "hum."

While we have a number of theories, both the Research and Engineering teams seem to be in agreement... the shard itself is acting as some form of communications relay. Although purely speculative, we've also considered the possibility that the Outsider itself is merely an extension of the shard and its function. Dr. Shen believes with sufficient time, he may be able to develop a device or "key" that mimics the shard itself, giving us the means to locate the source of the signal.


New Fighter Craft
-----------------------------

After an exhaustive reverse-engineering effort by the research team, we now believe it should be possible to mirror the functionality exhibited by the alien's advanced flight and navigational computers. These systems provide the pilot with a depth of information well-beyond our current avionics package, and will certainly bring us closer to matching the alien ships in combat.

Perhaps more importantly, we've successfully integrated our first prototype of the "gravity wave" drive we modeled after the alien propulsion systems. With this mechanism in place, we can expect at minimum a twofold increase in the Firestorm's maximum thrust output when compared to our traditional pulse-engine equipped Interceptors.

Assuming Dr. Shen and his team are able to successfully complete the fabrication process, our ship should be every bit as fast and deadly as the alien's own craft.


Hyperwave Communication
-----------------------------

Although we've studied a number of unusual pieces of alien technology up to this point, the equipment recovered from the alien base on Earth is among the most cryptic. When we first encountered this device, it appeared that the Sectoid Commander was somehow interacting with it through a non-physical link... using some type of mental telepathy or another equally mysterious form of communication.

Having now studied the device further, we believe this is undoubtedly the case. Our testing has revealed a pattern of signals being transmitted at a wavelength never before associated with any form of communications or electronic transmissions. Although we should not be surprised at this point by the advanced nature of the alien technology, this particular discovery is a bit... unsettling.

As far-fetched as it may seem, several members of the research team have theorized that this device may be capable of transmitting and receiving signals beyond our own dimension. The implications of this possibility affect all areas of known science, and perhaps more alarmingly, indicate that the Sectoid Commander may have been receiving signals or... orders... from a higher authority.

While continuing to analyze the transmission we've detected, we have also moved forward in our attempts to interface the device with our own satellite communications network. If my suspicions are correct, this beacon may provide us with a means of detecting previously unknown contacts.


Ethereal Device
-----------------------------

Having learned a great deal about the Hyperwave Beacon and its associated "inter-dimensional" signaling capabilities, we believe this newly recovered device confirms our suspicions about this technology and takes it a step further. The "Psi-Link," as it is now being called, appears to provide a direct link to the psionic "network" used by the aliens for field communications. Although we are treading into an area of highly theoretical science, we believe there is a strong indication that the aliens function under a collective consciousness, a form of social organization akin to a "hive mind" as seen in various species of insects found on Earth. It wasn't until our first interaction with the Ethereal species of alien that we were able to understand the scope of the psionic abilities we had previously been exposed to.

Although we've only scratched the surface in terms of developing Psionic abilities within a human subject, we've now theorized that it may be possible to join the aliens' consciousness ... to tap into their "hive mind," by successfully activating this device.

However, in order to ensure the safety of XCOM's headquarters, we'll need to construct a chamber that minimizes the potential risks to the rest of the facility during the activation process. As it so happens, two of our brightest young minds, a team of brothers, have already conceived of just such a facility appropriate to this task. If we manage to locate a soldier with an aptitude for psionics, and find a means to develop these abilities further, I believe it will only be a matter of time before we succeed in activating the device and finding the source of this invasion.


Meld Recombination
-----------------------------

This amazing material's most salient feature is its versatility. In early testing, we were able to devise several methods that allow for direct manipulation of the Meld substance and its physiochemical properties. While searching our records for any references to a material with similar properties, I uncovered a number of redacted data stores created in the 1960s, but much of that information appears to be lost. In any case, the advances we've made should allow for a wide range of applications in the fields of genetic modification and cybernetic enhancement, although we will need to build dedicated facilities to enable these potential research pathways. It is probable that the invaders are more familiar with Meld than we are, and may already be fielding combat elements that take full advantage of its capabilities.



-----

Sectoid Autopsy
-----------------------------

We've found no discernible genetic variance between any of the small humanoid aliens that have been examined thus far. They are perfect genetic copies, each and every one of them. The subject's brain is quite sizable with respect to its body, and appears to have been augmented even further with cybernetic implants of some kind. Considering the... fragile nature of this creatures physical form, it is safe to assume that these implants were intended to somehow improve the combat effectiveness of the species. Dr. Shen and the engineering team have already developed several theories as to how we might be able to adapt these implants for our own use. Additional tactical information may be available in the field when viewing hostile targets in the Unit Analysis View.

Dr. Vahlen's Personal Note: Cloning, genetic manipulation, biomedical implants... the implications of this technology and the alien's motives are not reassuring.


Interrogate Sectoid
-----------------------------

Our interrogation of the small alien captive was a learning experience for all parties involved. Although traditionally an interrogation would imply a discussion of sorts, perhaps under coercion, that possibility was out of the question given these unique circumstances. We were instead forced to undertake a more aggressive approach, namely, through a series of invasive cranial probes inserted into the subject's prefrontal cortex.

By interpreting the captive's responses to various stimuli, we were able to discern a great deal of information... more so than I had originally anticipated. Although it seemed to have little understanding of the various modifications it had been subjected to at some point in the past, we did garner some information relating to the aliens miniaturized implants and power cells used in their weaponry. We've already begun analyzing this data for possible incorporation into future advanced weapons prototypes, including several power-intensive beam weapons.


Thin Man Autopsy
-----------------------------

The subject's external appearance is that of a caucasian male. I would guess its age to be approximately 35 years old, although it's quite likely this is an artificial effect intentionally affixed by the aliens. The specimen is roughly two meters in height, and weighs just over 80 kilograms. Despite its outward appearance, upon dissection, the creature's unique organ and bone structure is revealed to be distinctly alien in nature. The subject's bones are segmented, rather like the vertebrae of a serpent. This segmented structure appears to give the creature a spectacular range of motion in combat.

A large portion of the specimen's thoracic cavity is devoted to enormous glands capable of producing a toxin that is then expelled via ducts with considerable force. After a thorough chemical analysis of the subject's venom, we've theorized that it could be used as a powerful disinfectant to treat our soldiers injuries in the field. Dr. Shen is working to develop a means to integrate this substance into our existing Medikits for future deployment. Targeting another example of this specimen in the field using the Unit Analysis View may reveal further details about its distinctive combat abilities.


Interrogate Thin Man
-----------------------------

Capturing one of the invaders' infiltration specialists has proven both illuminating and disturbing. Although at first glance they resemble the human form, and are trained to communicate in a range of terrestrial languages, this specimen is far from human. We had assumed its role as an infiltration unit would preclude us from gaining anything of value during our interrogation. However, as it turns out, the captive was surprisingly...pliable once we began the procedure.

Aside from its primary role as a reconnaissance and infiltration specialist, the Thin Man also proved to be quite familiar with the alien's navigation systems and celestial cartography. The information gained from this interrogation is of crucial importance to our efforts in reverse engineering the alien navigational computers and related systems.


Floater Autopsy
-----------------------------

As frightening and vicious as this species is on the battlefield, it is hard not to feel some sympathy for them on the dissection table. The specimen has been subjected to extensive biomedical modifications, some of which were undoubtedly quite painful and intrusive. The combination of living tissue and mechanical components gives the creature the look of a cruel, half-finished experiment. Most of the subject's internal organs have been replaced with a mechanical life support system that mimics their original functionality.

A rather conventional propulsion system has been grafted onto the subjects torso, although the power cells supplying the necessary thrust are extremely advanced by our own standards. I have removed a number of neural implants from the subject that appear to aid in the evasion of incoming projectile file. The engineering team has already suggested several ways in which this technology might benefit our soldiers. You may find additional information about the combat capabilities of this species by targeting one in the field using the Unit Analysis View.


Interrogate Floater
-----------------------------

As far as we can tell, the specimen known as the Floater is barely sentient, at least in any discernible fashion that would imply intelligence. Perhaps this was an intentional move on the part of the aliens, but in any case, the Floater was extremely aggressive throughout the interrogation process. The most interesting aspect of its bizarre physique is the propulsion module integrated into the remaining portion of its upper torso. During controlled flight testing within the labs, we were able to observe how the Floater is capable of controlling and modulating the flow of power into the propulsion system itself. This was a significant discovery, one that will surely benefit our ongoing research into the alien technology as we attempt to adapt these concepts for our own purposes.


Chryssalid Autopsy
-----------------------------

Even after years of research and study, until now I have never encountered something that is quite as beautiful, yet equally as deadly, as this species. Unlike the other aliens we've encountered thus far, it is arthropodal in nature, plated in a sleek, black exoskeleton. The "Chryssalids", as we're calling them, based on their reproductive habits, measure over three meters long from nose to tail, and stand almost two meters high when perched on their hind legs. Their attack is not only extremely deadly, but also necessary for their reproduction, as the intended victim is not immediately killed, but instead turned into what can only be described as a mindless shell, akin to a Zombie, which serves as host to its offspring. When a human is bitten an embryo is injected into the host and immediately begins to gestate. Once gestation is complete, which remarkably lasts only minutes, a newborn Chryssalid will emerge, destroying its host in the process.

One can only wonder why the aliens would use what appears to be a savage, unpredictable creature... in any case, this is certainly not a creature to be trifled with, and our troops would do well to exercise extreme caution when engaging this species. Targeting another example in the field through the Unit Analysis View may provide additional information as to its combat capabilities.


Cyberdisc Autopsy
-----------------------------

So far, we've been unable to ascertain whether this is strictly a mechanical creation or a living organism. Based on our findings, it has an alternative biochemical system based on the silicon atom. Like carbon, silicon can create molecules that are sufficiently large to carry biological information, and since silicon has several chemical properties similar to carbon, it is possible this could be a new and completely alien life form, with respect to the specimens we've already encountered. Its internal mechanisms seem to operate like organs, giving it the ability to circulate plasma through its core systems, much in the same way blood flows through our bodies. Our Unit Analysis View available in the field should provide additional specifics regarding this species' various combat abilities.


Drone Autopsy
-----------------------------

The "drones" we've disassembled seems to have a singular purpose: to repair the alien technology, including its robotic counterparts. Although they act as robotic medics, and lack any kind of offensive weaponry, we did discover a large explosive charge is located deep within the sub-structure it draws on as a power source. With this and several of the alien devices, I continue to be amazed by what their creators have been able to accomplish. Dr. Shen believes it may be possible to "hack" these drones, allowing us to utilize them for our own purposes. Further details as to this specimen's complete combat capabilities may be available in the field if targeted in the Unit Analysis View.


Muton Autopsy
-----------------------------

Standing well over two meters tall, the ratio of this subject's lean muscle to the rest of its body mass is staggering. Its bones are highly durable yet very light in weight, and it seems to lack extramuscular fatty tissue of any kind. There is no part of this subject that has not been genetically engineered for combat. These "Mutons" (a moniker given by the troops) have clearly been bred and modified from birth, with every enhancement contributing to its function as a sort of "organic tank." As such, the Mutons are capable of withstanding otherworldly amounts of damage and seem to have an incredible tolerance for pain.

During the autopsy, we also noted a variety of ritualistic markings and unusual tattoos, which imply some sort of past tribal structure among the Muton species. We've also noticed a number of distinct similarities between the genetic structure of the Muton and Floater specimens. Although I can only guess as to the alien's intentions, it certainly appears that the Floaters may have at one time been Mutons themselves. If the aliens have been experimenting with the Muton physiology, perhaps the Floaters are a byproduct of their less successful attempts at genetic manipulation.

We may be able to gain further insight into this creature's combat capabilities by targeting another example in the field in the Unit Analysis View.


Interrogate Muton
-----------------------------

On first impressions, the captive Muton would appear to be among the least intelligent of any of the alien species we've encountered. Hulking and brutish in form, we were surprised to discover a great deal of knowledge had been ingrained in this subject's memory. We realized during the interrogation process that it was only logical for the aliens to provide the Muton with a complete understanding of their weaponry and tactics, as this beast represents their most formidable front-line combatant.

Although the Muton was quite resistant to our techniques, despite heavy sedation, we've learned a great deal from the captive about the alien weaponry, particularly their advanced plasma-based armaments. The research team will begin analyzing this data for possible use in a new breed of weapons of our own design.


Berserker Autopsy
-----------------------------

Although similar to the previously cataloged Muton species, this particular specimen is... different. Our troops have taken to calling this beast the "Berserker," based on its uncharacteristically aggressive tactics in the field. Despite sharing the same physiological structure of the other Mutons, for reasons yet unknown to us, the Berserker seems to be consumed by blood lust, charging into combat with little regard for its own safety. Current theories as to the cause of this behavior have led us to begin investigating possible genetic manipulation of the subject's endocrine glands, or, in the case, the equivalent glands that appear to secrete androgenic hormones. If the aliens enlarged or modified the action of these glands, it could explain the Berserker's outbursts. Specifics on this creature's abilities in combat should be available when using the Unit Analysis View on another specimen of the same type in the field.


Interrogate Berserker
-----------------------------

This captive was even more violent and aggressive than we expected, exceeding the previous limit established by the Floater and Muton species. Despite heavy sedation, it was virtually impossible to control the subject, leaving us with little recourse other than to increase the vigor of our tactics. After probing several regions of the captive's brain, we managed to find the appropriate stimulus to calm the beast, after which we put the captive through a number of controlled physical tests.

By observing the subject's movements while burdened by the massive suit of armor it is outfitted with, we've gained enormous insight into how the invaders approach the difficult design questions associated with creating a heavy armor suit. Striking a balance between effective armor coverage and maneuverability in the field is no easy task, but this data should prove invaluable to our own efforts.


Sectoid Commander Autopsy
-----------------------------

After an extensive analysis of this specimen's brain tissue, we've discovered some unusual activity in the synaptic connections that may be the source of the... abilities our troops encountered in the field. Although somewhat similar in physical appearance to the Sectoid we previously identified, this "Commander" variant has an easily differentiated internal composition. We've theorized that these "enhanced electrical synapses," capable of transmitting nerve impulses at nearly three times the normal rate, are the product of careful genetic manipulation. If our theory holds true, that means the aliens are capable of modifying even the most complex tissue at a genetic level...


Interrogate Sectoid Commander
-----------------------------

This specimen has a uniquely defined cellular structure within its brain, augmented by a series of advanced cybernetic implants that must have been ingrained shortly after its "birth." Due to the unusual abilities exhibited by this captive in the field, we've had to be particularly cautious during the interrogation process. Evidence of a telekinetic power unlike anything previously recorded in known science has left some members of the research team unwilling to approach the subject.

We were met with limited success in retrieving new information directly from the captive, although we have come to understand how the captive was able to interact with the mysterious device we found within the alien base. We've also had to to further analyze the modules implanted in the subject's body, which will likely lead to a number of unexpected advances.


Heavy Floater Autopsy
-----------------------------

Another variation on a previously identified specimen, this is the "Heavy Floater." A cursory examination reveals substantial improvements to the armor and weapons systems available to the creature. Much of the exposed tissue, the Floater's most obvious vulnerability, has ether been shielded or removed entirely. With these modifications in mind, it would appear the aliens chose to move towards a greater reliance on mechanical and cybernetic upgrades rather than continue developing the specimen's organic form. We may be able to gain further insight into this creature's unique abilities in combat of another specimen is targeted in the field in the Unit Analysis View.


Interrogate Heavy Floater
-----------------------------

Similar in overall appearance to the Floater specimen we've previously encountered, this captive has been enhanced further with an ever more complex network of cybernetic implants. There is also a significant reduction in exposed living tissue, including the cranial region, which slowed the progression of our interrogation process. Despite these initial setbacks, we were able to gauge the captive's response to various stimuli, while also conducting a battery of tests on the propulsion systems integrated into its body. Having observed a number of subtle improvements in this specimen's augmented frame, we should be able to enhance the flight characteristics and propulsion systems of our aircraft.


Muton Elite Autopsy
-----------------------------

Although they seem to have the distinct honor of serving as guards within the alien hierarchy, our autopsy of this specimen reveals little in the way of distinguishing anatomical traits versus the typical Muton. Aside from various improvements to their armor, the primary difference appears to be a slightly enhanced intelligence which makes them more effective combatants. The details surrounding this creature's specific combat capabilities should be available during future encounters by targeting one in the Unit Analysis View.


Interrogate Muton Elite
-----------------------------

Although similar in general appearance to the Muton species our troops have battled in the field, this particular captive is different. We've seen evidence of an inherent intellectual capacity not found in the other variants, and we believe this "Elite" Muton serves a more defined role within the invasion force.

The captive's sheer physical power and increased savvy made its interrogation both dangerous and exhilarating. After establishing an enhanced security protocol to deal with the risks involved, we began the interrogation process using our previously established techniques. As it turns out, this captive had the distinct honor of serving as a guard within the alien force, and had a complete understanding of the various weapon systems available to the invaders. With this knowledge in hand, I believe this information will greatly reduce the time we spend researching and developing these advanced new weapons.


Sectopod Autopsy
-----------------------------

Although this robot is neither alive nor sentient, it is strangely self-aware of its surroundings. We've still uncovering the functional details for this "species," but from what we've seen so far, this machine is a masterpiece of technology. Based on our initial testing, we've discovered an extremely intricate program that's implanted in their macro-processors. This combat control program, combined with the Sectopods imposing ten meter frame, makes for an extremely dangerous weapon. Powered by the same energy source that fuels the alien craft, these machines wield unparalleled destructive power. Perhaps the biggest mystery is the secret of how they're being controlled. Additional information regarding this specimen's tactical abilities may be available in the field if another of these machines is targeted in the Unit Analysis View.


Ethereal Autopsy
-----------------------------

This specimen appears to be at the top of the alien hierarchy, and for good reason. As we've noted in the field, its physical form is not suited for combat by any means. Their bodies actually appear to be quite frail, with evidence of atrophy and muscular degeneration having occurred over an extended period of time. This is not surprising, as initial radiocarbon dating indicates this particular creature could be... several thousand years old. Unlike the other specimens we've examined, there is little to indicate that it was genetically enhanced, at least not with the same ambition as the others.

Strangely enough, we have uncovered similarities between the "Ethereal" brain and that of the Sectoid Commander. Both show the same enhanced synaptic connections, confirming our suspicion that this is the likely source of their power. These Ethereals appear to have an incredible pool of psionic energy at their disposal... more than anything we've previously encountered, which helps to explain why the other species are subordinate to them. The Unit Analysis View should provide additional information about this creature's combat capabilities in the field.


Interrogate Ethereal
-----------------------------

This creature, clearly a member of the alien leadership caste responsible for this invasion, presented us with an extremely risky and difficult interrogation prospect. Despite our previous experience in safeguarding the facility from the potential effects of the...abilities... exhibited by the psionic alien species, this captive's power exceeded the previously established limits of our testing.

Much of the information we were able to discern from this creature was cryptic at best, as it made every effort to resist even our most invasive procedures during the interrogation. However, the experimental imaging equipment we had been using to monitor the alien's brain activity did reveal a very unusual pattern of neural activity that we believe is closely tied to the creature's "power." This information should prove useful in reducing the time required for our research in a variety of fields.


Mechtoid Autopsy
-----------------------------

As it appears that the Sectoid creature within this mechanized armor is of the same biological makeup we had seen previously, most of our efforts were spent disassembling and analyzing the inner workings of the armor itself - in close collaboration with Dr. Shen's team, of course. As our soldiers quickly discovered in the field, this suit is equipped with two substantially larger and more powerful plasma weapons when compared with the standard Sectoid equipment. The armor itself provides a great deal of protection to the operator, while also maintaining an impressive degree of mobility. The suit is capable of climbing over rough terrain and seems to have no trouble even with staircases and other obstacles, as it is also maneuverable enough to operate confidently in enclosed spaces.

One of the more interesting discoveries we made while examining this subject is that the suit's armor plating appears to interfere to some degree with the Sectoid pilot's unique mental capabilities. I can assume that this was an unintended consequence of the additional armor plating - the aliens sacrificed what would appear to be an extremely powerful ability as a tradeoff for an increase in sheer combat power. However, it should be noted that the aliens seem to have offset this potential disadvantage by implementing a new technology. A small module located within the armor's core appears to serve as a sort of "amplifier" for these telepathic abilities. When targeted by an allied unit, rather than linking the two, the amplifier seems to takes this power and use it to form a sort of shield around the suit. Our troops should be wary of this capability, as the suit is already quite formidable without the additional shielding in place.


Seeker Autopsy
-----------------------------

Although each of the autopsies we've conducted on the various alien species could be considered unusual, this latest specimen continues to push the boundaries of how we might define that characteristic. It's been referred to as a "Seeker" by our soldiers in the field due to its propensity for tracking and engaging with single targets - and its actual means of attack is quite shocking. Once it has located a target, the Seeker physically seizes the victim, and remains attached until it is either removed by force or the target expires.

As one might imagine, this is an extraordinarily disturbing situation for both the victim and anyone witnessing the attack. The challenge in stopping the Seeker comes from its inherent agility and nimbleness, making it extremely difficult to intercept before it manages to reach its intended target. We believe the micro-motors employed in its design are responsible for this notable degree of mobility. The Seeker has also been observed deploying a type of defensive smoke screen, making it even more troublesome to engage during the limited window of opportunity when it is immobile.

It is my hope that we can adapt these various concealment techniques into a form that allows our soldiers greater stealth capabilities in combat, which should reduce casualties. It may also be possible to use what we've learned to develop weapons systems and equipment that mirror some of these techniques. Our Unit Analysis View available in the field should provide additional specifics regarding this species' various combat abilities.

Weapon Fragments
-----------------------------

Although the alien weapon fragments provide a limited glimpse into the system utilized in their equipment, we've seen enough to confirm my worst suspicions about their technology... that is it is vastly superior to our own. However, I have been encouraged by the rapid developments the research team has made in studying the damaged circuitry and electronics we recovered. Our initial efforts have already yielded a successful outcome. The new integrated sighting module created for our weaponry was heavily influenced by the aliens' own targeting system.


Beam Weapons
-----------------------------

By studying the methods used by the aliens to manage energy consumption and heat dissipation in their weapons, we've advanced our existing laser-based weaponry designs well beyond what we had previously envisioned. Remarkably, we now have a working prototype, a development that had at one time been considered impossible. Although we've had to reduce the size of the focusing lenses in the process, we've found very little decrease in the overall output accuracy of the weapon during initial testing.


Heavy Lasers
-----------------------------

We've finally found a workable solution to the heat dissipation issues we've struggled with when attempting to create a more powerful laser weapon for our troops. Although this variant still operates near the limit of what would ordinarily be considered "safe" operating temperatures, we believe it is stable enough at this point to begin fabrication in engineering.

While developing this laser for our troops, we also blueprinted a variation suitable for mounting to our Interceptors. Attaching this weapon to one of our ship's hardpoints should provide a significant boost in firepower to our pilots when engaging the alien craft.


Precision Lasers
-----------------------------

After a number of failed experiments, we've finally succeeded in focusing an accelerated energy pulse through a narrow-field lens while still maintaining adequate energy efficiency. The result is an extremely capable weapon akin to a traditional sniper rifle, but with a much greater chance of inflicting critical damage on enemy targets. We believe this weapon is now ready for deployment in the field, once Dr. Shen and his team complete the fabrication process.

During our testing we've also deployed another prototype operating under the same principle, but relying on a modified prism to scatter the beam rather than focus it. We envision this weapon filling the same tactical role as a traditional shotgun, but without the ammunition constraints... and with a greater damage output. However, as with our other laser-based weaponry, heat dissipation issues continue to plague these designs.


Plasma Pistol
-----------------------------

Our research into the alien's plasma based weaponry is among the most advanced and dangerous work we've undertaken so far. The most difficult question surrounding the use of plasma... how to maintain an adequate power supply in the field, was solved by the Elerium-based power cells recovered from the aliens. The heat sinks developed using their materials have also proven to be the answer to proper heat dissipation along the weapon's barrel. With this knowledge in hand, we should now be able to use any plasma pistols we've captured from the invaders, as well as begin manufacturing variants of our own design.


Light Plasma Rifle
-----------------------------

Although we continue to gain a better understanding of the alien plasma weapons we've recovered with each passing day, adapting the technology is but one aspect of the process involved in designing these weapons. We must also ensure that the armaments we develop are suitable to the firing positions our troops are accustomed to... if the weapon doesn't conform to human ergonomic standards, our troops certainly won't be able to fire it effectively. As a result of our efforts to reduce the weapon's weight, we've noted a substantial improvement in the overall accuracy of this rifle. In addition to manufacturing these new lightweight plasma rifles, we can also apply this approach to modify any plasma rifles captured in the field.


Plasma Rifle
-----------------------------

It took an extensive effort by the research team to reduce the considerable mass of the larger alien plasma rifle. By replacing the outer frame components with composite materials, we've managed to substantially reduce the weight, without compromising the weapon's power output or accuracy. These reductions did coincide with the added heft of a larger power supply, but we still managed to net an overall reduction of several kilograms. The substantial increases in firing rate and overall damage output versus our other prototype variants also required some additional modifications to the integrated Elerium power cell.

The end result of this work is a highly advanced, mobile plasma discharge weapon that improves on nearly all aspects of the conventional X-9 rifle. I believe the engineering team is now on standby to begin production of this weapon at your discretion. Any alien rifles recovered from the field can also be modified for our own use following the techniques we've developed.


Heavy Plasma
-----------------------------

We've struggled to maintain a test environment that minimizes the safety risks involved in these experiments, but at the same time does not limit our ... imagination, when it comes to new developments. With those logistical issues handled efficiently enough by the engineering team, we proceeded in our initial prototyping.

Although we spent a great deal of time studying the alien's own heavy plasma rifle, there were still a number of questions surrounding its enhanced functionality. Maintaining an acceptable level of energy efficiency, while also increasing the weapon's output, was not an easy task. The primary constraint of increasing the output was the added weight involved by the inclusion of a larger power cell. While this issue may not have affected some of the brutish soldiers employed by the aliens, there are limits to what our soldiers can realistically carry. However, by redesigning the power management system to reduce waste energy generated during the firing process, we've managed to strike a balance between all of these concerns. I should mention however that heat buildup continues to be a concern, and our troops will have to be aware of this when firing the weapon in rapid succession.

Having successfully test fired our prototype, as well as a modified version of the alien's own variant, we believe it should now be possible to both manufacture these weapons and adapt any we manage to recover from the field.


Plasma Sniper
-----------------------------

Perhaps it was inevitable that we eventually be called upon to develop a weapon of this kind, just as we did with the advent of laser based weapons. By concentrating our efforts on a single, focused discharge of plasma, and ignoring some of the previous design constraints regarding size, weight, and rate of fire, we've developed an extremely lethal long range weapon. Our snipers will undoubtedly be pleased with this weapon's ability to devastate hostile targets from previously unheard of distances.

In any case, this weapon is now ready for fabrication in engineering.


Guided Fusion Launcher
-----------------------------

Although I was skeptical as to the merits of assemble another weapon based on our traditional methods, namely, large rockets carrying heavy payloads of explosives, we have made some interesting discoveries during our testing. Our prototype, the cleverly named "blaster launcher," has been surprisingly effective in penetrating the alien's seemingly unassailable armor plating.

We've also improved on the integrated targeting module by implementing several of the design improvements observed in the alien weapons. As a result, these rockets are capable of guiding themselves, even when fired from an obstructed line of sight. I believe there is still room for us to hone this weapon's capabilities further, but it should be safe to begin manufacturing the current design as you see fit.

Alien Materials
-----------------------------

Our understanding of the alien materials is limited at best, and we could spend years deciphering the complex manufacturing processes required to produce and manipulate these substances. However, we have managed to crudely adapt some of the observed techniques into our own research. Our first development, a multi-walled carbon nanotube weave, was modeled after an unusual pattern mirrored in several of the alien materials. This new configuration has proven to possess a greater tensile strength than any material previously recorded in known science. Adapting this fiber into an armor reinforcing vest will surely afford our soldiers increased protection on the battlefield.


Carapace Armor
-----------------------------

We've succeeded in creating an advanced suit of body armor based on the alien alloys recovered from the field. These are the same materials used extensively by the aliens in the hull plating and internal structure of their craft. As we've already seen, the UFOs are capable of sustaining heavy impacts with only minor structural damage, which inspired our research into personal armor plating of the same design.

However the downside to this exotic material is that we have no way of replicating it on Earth. With a limited pool of resources available for future projects, we'll need to manage our use of these alloys carefully. The engineering team is awaiting orders to begin the fabrication process. Once completed we can see how this "Carapace" armor fares on the battlefield.


Skeleton Suit
-----------------------------

Having reviewed a number of reports from our soldiers deployed on past combat missions, we felt it was necessary to address their concerns regarding a need for a powered-ascent mechanism to scale objects in the field. With that goal in mind, this medium-density armor was developed using the alien alloys to reduce weight wherever possible. Despite the reduction in overall plate thickness, the protective qualities of this armor have been maintained through a use of a multilayered composite lining within the suit.

The integration of a pneumatic grapple unit provides our troops with the ability to scale objects for a tactical height advantage when needed. The micro-servomotors utilized by this system also augment the reflexes of anyone wearing the suit, improving the odds that the operator will avoid incoming enemy fire, while also increasing the available movement range.


Ghost Armor
-----------------------------

An advanced prototype based on our earlier Skeleton armor design, this variation makes use of our latest developments in the field of optical camouflage. By studying the unusual phasing behavior exhibited by the Hyperwave beacon, we've come to understand how this device is capable of existing outside of our visible plane. With this "phasing" behavior in mind, we've implemented several experimental metamaterials into the weave and structure of this suit's outermost layers. As a result, the "Ghost" armor provides near-invisibility to the wearer, allowing for enhanced evasion and infiltration capabilities in the field.


Titan Armor
-----------------------------

Among the heaviest of our body armor prototypes, the "Titan" armor makes use of the alien element known as Elerium to provide a continual powered assist to the operator of this suit as they move through the battlefield. With the element in short supply, we've tried to find the most efficient means to utilize it in our development programs.

In this case, the Elerium power cell is used to fuel an integrated cooling system designed to minimize fatigue by regulating the operator's body temperature. This system gives the Titan Armor the added benefit of increased resistance to the environmental hazards, particularly fire and poison damage.


Archangel Armor
-----------------------------

As it turns out, our initial optimism about the design of this particular suit was entirely justified. having successfully developed a miniaturized version of the alien propulsion modules recovered from the field, we've now successfully integrated this device into a suit of heavy armor. Although we've exceeded the weight of the original Floater specimen these propulsion unites were adapted from, we believe our adjustments to the system have actually improved their overall efficiency. As a result of our efforts, this suit is capable of providing limited flight capabilities to the wearer.


Psi Armor
-----------------------------

We've reached a point in our research of the aliens' Psionic abilities and their associated cybernetic implants that we're confident enough to begin preliminary tests of this technology on human subjects. Although the system we have in mind will require the use of a lightweight armor suit with reduced defensive capabilities, this "Psi-armor" should more than compensate by providing a significant boost to our soldiers psionic abilities.

It is our hope that bolstering these abilities within our soldiers will provide new insights, as we seek to discover the source of the aliens' collective consciousness. We still don't fully understand the link between the visible psionic abilities we've seen exhibited by the aliens, and their use of psionics as a means of communication. I believe it's very likely we'll find a way to activate the Ethereal Device if we can successfully fabricate this armor.

Alloy Cannon
-----------------------------

The alien alloys have proven to be extremely difficult to forge and manipulate for use in our theoretical designs. Machining the alloy was an arduous process, leaving us with limited options as to what it could be used for. Although we considered the alien alloy's density a benefit, one that made it ideal for use as an advanced form of projectile ammunition, the material proved to be so dense that it ate directly into the weapon's barrel, making it useless after a single firing.

After a number of failed attempts, we finally managed to develop a barrel sleeve made from the alloys, which has so far survived several hundred test firings during our experiments. With the 'Alloy Cannon', as we've been calling it, now operational, we've had ample time to study the effects of its design. Although similar to a traditional shotgun configuration, because of its specialized ammunition, the alloy cannon is substantially more powerful, and deadly.

Testing on targets made up of a modified ballistic gel proved pointless, as the targets were completely penetrated by the alloy munitions, despite an average thickness of roughly two meters. Needless to say, this weapon will have a similar effect on any hostile targets our troops might encounter.


Plasma Cannon
-----------------------------

As we've continually strived to "even the odds" for our pilots facing the alien craft in combat, one of our most important developments was the research engineering of their plasma-based weaponry. Having successfully created a variant for our troops on the ground, the most difficult part of our work was already done. Increasing the size and firepower of these weapons for an application suitable to our Interceptors was a relatively straightforward process. Once we confirmed that the ship itself could handle the stress associated with firing these weapons, it was simply a matter of scaling up the device and creating an appropriate mount.

We believe the plasma cannon is now ready for general fabrication in engineering, and I'm confident our pilots will appreciate the additional firepower it provides.


EMP Cannon
-----------------------------

In developing an electromagnetic weapon capable of emitting a focused pulse that will penetrate the alien's advanced shielding, we've also had to find a way to protect our own ship's sensitive electronic circuitry. The functionality of the weapon itself had already been well-established by previous testing conducted by Earth's various terrestrial military forces, leaving us with little to determine outside of the energy requirements and effective range.

Although the additional shielding required to protect our systems will necessitate a reconfiguration of our ship's hardpoints for the weapon's mount, I expect the engineering team will have no trouble fitting the device into position. If our pilots can successfully deploy the pulse against the alien craft, we should be able to bring down a UFO with minimal damage to the artifacts and equipment carried inside.


Fusion Lance
-----------------------------

This weapon is among the most powerful we've recovered from the aliens, and we've already evidence of its devastating effect against our own aircraft. Unfortunately, it was clearly designed for a much larger craft with a greater payload capacity than anything we have currently available. In order to adapt the mechanism for use on our own ships, we've had to redesign the integrated power and cooling systems to a much smaller form factor.

If we do manage to successfully deploy this weapon, I have no doubt we'll finally level the playing field with the aliens in terms of air superiority.
